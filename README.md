# Journey Into The Nether

## Creation of this Masterpiece

This is a game that I had created in about 5 weeks. During the process, there were a lot of ideas I had about the game. I finally chose to make a Minecraft themed shooting game, just like Galaga except a lot more basic. As I was creating this game I had to learn many different new things that I had no idea how to do. Over this entire time I spent on the game I had fun doing it and would love to do something along the lines of this.

## History Lesson

### Minecraft

Minecarft is an open world survival/sandbox game created by Swedish developer Notch in 2011. It allows you to take a journey through the open world of Minecraft and explore the many different areas that lay beneath and beyond your eyesight. As you explore you will we greeted withmany different creatures ranging from pigs to squids lurking around each biome there is to explore. Also, once night time comes around you will find yourself surrouned by deadly enemies, also known as mobs.Survive the night and make it to day, then rinse and repeat until you become a very well educated survivor.

### Steve (You)

In Minecraft, Steve is the most basic skin that someone could use. He is the original main character skin to the Minecraft world. The things that make Steve look the way he does is his dark brown hair, dark skin, nose and mouth, and blue eyes, with a light blue shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and the durable yet breathtaking gray shoes. Steve is supposed to represent the average day human and he does a good job of looking that way.

### The Nether

The Nether is basically the hell of Minecraft. Everything inside of it wants to kill you and restrict your access around it. It is filled will tough terrain that is surrounded by lava. If you make one mistake you will be blasted off the side and fall in lava, losing all of your precious items. Along witht he lave there are a large quantity of dangerous mobs that want to kill you. The player can only get into the Nether by creating an Ender Portal out of at least 10 Obsidian and something to light up the center. You will spawn somewhere random and have to traverse your way throught the Nether cautiously. Unless you really need something, this isn't where you want to be.

### Ghasts

The Ghasts are these huge mobs that only spawn inside of the Nether. They are big, all white blocks that have a face that is constantly crying with its eyes closed. The tear drops run about halfway down his face creating a eerie vibe about it. The Ghasts like to shoot fireballs at the player and attempt to kill. They dont have a lot of health but theysure can dish out a ton of damage to anything.

### Blaze

The Blaze are only found amongst the world of the Nether. These are enemies that like to shoot a tripple shot of fireballs no matter if they are gonna hit you, THEY WILL SHOOT!. They are made up of Blaze Rods that surrounded and float around the big pile of fire and smoke that they are made up of. These will stay on the ground, but sometimes they will float up and get a higher angle on you to commence their firing. Just keep in mind that their weakness is water so use that to your advantage.

## How to Play

Once the game is booted up, you will be greeeted with a very artsy titlescreen, overlooking a nether castle. Once the screen is entirely loaded you will want to press the Spacebar to journey down into the depths of the Nether as the Minecraft character named Steve.. once the Nether is reached you will want to defend yourself from the flying Ghasts and Blazes. The monster will come flying down at you and you will want to use the arrow keys to move left and right to dodge them and using Spacebar to throw your diamond swords at them. Each monster has 10 health along with yourself, so be careful not to get hit by the fireballs 10 times. Once you die or kill the monsters you will be presented with an end game screen. WHile this screen is in eyes view you will see your score and a suggestion to press 'r'r to return to titlescreen. If you press 'r' you will be able to begin your journey into the Nether once again.
