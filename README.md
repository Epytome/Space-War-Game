# Journey Into The Nether

## Creation of this Masterpiece

This is a game that I had created in about 5 weeks. During the process, there were a lot of ideas I had about the game. I finally chose to make a Minecraft themed shooting game, just like Galaga except a lot more basic. As I was creating this game I had to learn many different new things that I had no idea how to do. Over this entire time I spent on the game I had fun doing it and would love to do something along the lines of this.

## History Lesson

## How to Play

Once the game is booted up, you will be greeeted with a very artsy titlescreen, overlooking a nether castle. Once the screen is entirely loaded you will want to press the Spacebar to journey down into the depths of the Nether as the Minecraft character named Steve.. once the Nether is reached you will want to defend yourself from the flying Ghasts and Blazes. The monster will come flying down at you and you will want to use the arrow keys to move left and right to dodge them and using Spacebar to throw your diamond swords at them. Each monster has 10 health along with yourself, so be careful not to get hit by the fireballs 10 times. Once you die or kill the monsters you will be presented with an end game screen. WHile this screen is in eyes view you will see your score and a suggestion to press 'r'r to return to titlescreen. If you press 'r' you will b able to begin your journy into the Nether once again.
